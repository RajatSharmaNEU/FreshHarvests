We have designed and developed a grocery store website named as ‘FreshHarvests’. 
The website will first display a home page where it allows the user to sign up and create their profile. Then user can then login using their username and password. After logging in, a user may search for groceries or even nearby grocery stores. A simple search function will be useful for finding the things the user needs to purchase online. This website will display a list of all the grocery stores and products grouped by name, location, kind of store, preferred products (fruits, vegetables, packaged meals, etc.). With this smart list, it will be much easier for the user to search for what they want to order. They can go through the lists, select a grocery vendor nearby and place the order. Users can then select all their items from all different places they want, add these items to a cart and place the order all at once. Moreover, shoppers may add products to a basket but finish the transaction the next day or at another time. A cart makes sure that the chosen items are stored in one place and that the order can be finished whenever the client is prepared to do so. Once the order is placed by the users, it’s time to checkout to complete the process. To make it easy for the user to pay online, this website provides with multiple payment options which include payment through credit cards, payment via debit card and PayPal, or even a cash delivery option. Once the order is placed and the payment is done this website also has a feature in where users can access the delivery guy’s contact details. Using this functionality, users will be able to get in touch with the delivery person and get the information. Website also contains the order history where the users can check their previously ordered items. Additionally, this website provides with a feature where the customers can track the progress of their order from dispatch to arrival at your doorstep.
